      <p>
        The Nordic AI Initiative represents a transformative opportunity to
        establish European leadership in ethical, sovereign artificial
        intelligence. This proposal outlines the creation of a publicly backed
        AI infrastructure platform, anchored in Sweden with broader Nordic
        cooperation, designed to provide a trusted, transparent alternative to
        private U.S. and Chinese AI systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        The initiative addresses three critical challenges: growing geopolitical
        instability around AI development, the concentration of AI capabilities
        in unaccountable private entities, and the absence of AI infrastructure
        aligned with European values of transparency, sustainability, and
        democratic governance.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Economic Opportunity:</strong> Conservative projections indicate
        potential revenues of €1B–3.5B annually by Year 5, scaling to
        €6.5B–14.5B by Year 10, with Sweden's public ownership potentially
        capturing €2B–6B annually in long-term value.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Strategic Timing:</strong> Recent developments including
        Northvolt's bankruptcy, growing concerns about AI safety and
        accountability, and Sweden's commitment to AI leadership create an
        unprecedented window for this initiative.
      </p>

    <div class="political-urgency">
      <h3 style="color: red">Political Urgency</h3>
      <p>
        We’re falling behind in the global AI race. Without decisive and
        substantial investment now, it will soon be too late to regain
        leadership. By 2030, AI will be integral to education, government, and
        society — but if we don’t act, those critical systems will be designed
        and controlled by foreign powers. The values shaping these technologies
        will reflect others’ priorities, not our own. The window to secure
        Nordic AI sovereignty is closing rapidly. If we fail to invest boldly
        today, we risk becoming dependent on external actors with little
        influence over the future of our digital infrastructure.
      </p>
      <p>
        At first glance, investing €10 billion, or even €5 billion in sovereign
        AI infrastructure might seem extreme. But what seems expensive today
        will seem cheap in hindsight — because the cost of catching up to
        existing AI powers grows exponentially over time.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h1 id="strategic-context">1. Strategic Context and Vision</h1>

    <h2 id="core-vision">1.1 Core Vision</h2>
    <p>
      The Nordic AI Initiative aims to establish a
      <strong>publicly backed AI infrastructure platform</strong> that
      represents Europe’s strategic response to the dominance of private AI
      monopolies. Unlike corporate AI systems that are primarily designed to
      maximize profits, this initiative emphasizes a different set of values. It
      seeks to build AI systems grounded in
      <strong>democratic accountability</strong>, ensuring that governance is
      transparent and subject to public oversight. Ethical alignment is a
      cornerstone, meaning that AI technologies should serve the broader
      societal good rather than narrow private interests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sustainability is another key priority. The platform is envisioned to
      operate in a <strong>carbon-neutral manner</strong>, leveraging the
      abundant renewable energy sources available in the Nordic countries.
      Sovereignty also plays a critical role: Europe must maintain control over
      its critical AI infrastructure and data to safeguard its autonomy in this
      strategically vital area. Finally, transparency is essential, with an
      <strong>open science approach</strong> that supports the use of auditable
      models and datasets.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fundamental premise behind this initiative is reminiscent of Europe’s
      historic achievements in strategic technology sectors — just as
      <strong>Airbus</strong> was developed to compete with Boeing, and
      <strong>CERN</strong> was created to advance fundamental physics research,
      the Nordic AI Initiative aims to build Europe’s independent capability in
      one of the most important technologies of the 21st century.
    </p>

    <h2 id="strategic-rationale">1.2 Strategic Rationale</h2>

    <h3 id="geopolitical-imperatives">Geopolitical Imperatives</h3>
    <p>
      Currently, the AI ecosystem is largely controlled by a few powerful
      private companies, mostly headquartered in the United States, with China
      also rapidly expanding its capabilities. This concentration raises several
      concerns for Europe. First, there is a
      <strong>democratic deficit</strong>: critical infrastructure is
      effectively governed by unelected private entities, which undermines
      public accountability. Second, dependence on foreign AI systems creates
      <strong>geopolitical vulnerabilities</strong>, as Europe's access to these
      technologies could be disrupted or influenced by external actors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, the flow of profits generated from European data and markets
      largely benefits foreign shareholders, leading to a
      <strong>value extraction problem</strong>. Finally, there is a risk that
      AI systems are optimized to prioritize user engagement and profit
      maximization rather than the broader societal benefit, which can lead to
      misaligned incentives and undesirable outcomes.
    </p>

    <h3 id="nordic-advantages">Nordic Competitive Advantages</h3>
    <p>
      The Nordic region offers a unique combination of strengths that make it
      especially well-suited to lead ethical AI development. One of the most
      significant assets is <strong>trust</strong>. Nordic countries
      consistently rank at the top in global indices measuring trust,
      transparency, and governance. This high-trust social fabric supports
      democratic AI governance and provides a stable foundation for long-term
      stewardship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Institutional stability is another advantage, with robust democratic
      institutions that have proven their ability to manage complex societal
      challenges over time. The Nordic countries have also demonstrated
      <strong>regulatory leadership</strong>, as exemplified by initiatives like
      GDPR, setting global standards for technology governance and digital
      rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the technical and economic front, the Nordics boast abundant
      <strong>clean energy resources</strong> — including hydroelectric, wind,
      and geothermal power — that are ideal for powering energy-intensive AI
      infrastructure sustainably. The region’s digital infrastructure is among
      the most advanced worldwide, with excellent broadband connectivity and
      state-of-the-art data centers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, the Nordic region benefits from world-class universities and
      research institutions, such as
      <strong>KTH, Chalmers, Lund, and Uppsala</strong>, which provide a strong

    </p>

    <div class="page-break"></div>

    <h1 id="foundational-framework">2. Foundational Framework</h1>

    <h2>2.1 Core Pillars of the Proposal</h2>

    <h3>Governance and Ownership Structure</h3>
    <p>
      The Nordic AI Initiative would operate under a
      <strong>government-backed foundation</strong> or sovereign fund structure
      designed to balance public accountability with operational independence.
      This hybrid governance model draws inspiration from successful Nordic
      institutions, such as Sweden’s AP pension funds, which benefit from strong
      insulation against political cycles. Public accountability is maintained
      through regular parliamentary oversight and citizen advisory boards,
      ensuring that decisions remain transparent and inclusive. Additionally,
      the initiative is anchored in Nordic cooperation frameworks, fostering
      collaborative governance across the region, while aligning with broader
      European digital sovereignty goals and funding mechanisms.
    </p>

    <h3>Infrastructure Investment Strategy</h3>
    <p>
      Prioritizing sustainability, the initiative focuses on developing
      <strong>green compute infrastructure</strong> throughout Nordic
      territories. Northern Sweden and Norway, with their abundant hydropower,
      wind resources, and naturally cool climates, are prime locations for
      energy-efficient data centers. The infrastructure will be designed with a
      <strong>distributed architecture</strong> in mind, connecting regional
      data centers through high-speed networks to maximize resilience and
      performance. Innovative sustainability measures like waste heat recovery
      will be integrated to supply district heating systems, reducing
      environmental impact. The entire system will be modular and scalable,
      allowing capacity to grow dynamically with demand.
    </p>

      Public reporting will be a regular practice, with detailed disclosures
      about AI capabilities, limitations, and safety assessments. Oversight will
      be ensured by parliamentary committees staffed with technical experts,
      providing ongoing democratic supervision. Furthermore, citizen
      participation will be encouraged through public consultations before major
      model deployments, fostering trust and inclusiveness.
    </p>

    <h3>Ethical AI Development</h3>
    <p>
      Ethical considerations are embedded throughout the initiative’s processes.
      An independent <strong>Ethics Board</strong>, comprising philosophers,
      technologists, and citizen representatives, will oversee AI development to
      ensure alignment with societal values. Dedicated research teams will focus
      on AI safety and value alignment, while systematic efforts will be made to
      identify and mitigate algorithmic bias. Ultimately, the AI systems
      developed will be designed to support and strengthen democratic
      institutions rather than undermine them, reflecting the core democratic
      values of the Nordic region.

    <h2 id="green-compute">3.1 Green Compute Infrastructure Development</h2>

    <h3>Why Energy Infrastructure Is Central to AI Leadership</h3>
    <p>
      Modern AI development is fundamentally limited by access to reliable and
      affordable energy. Large language models and other advanced AI systems
      demand immense computational power, not only for training but also for
      ongoing inference. Unlike many traditional industries, AI's energy
      consumption is <strong>continuous and predictable</strong>, requiring 24/7
      operation with consistent baseload demand. Its energy needs scale linearly
      with model complexity, making it highly <strong>scalable</strong>. The
      infrastructure can be located flexibly wherever there is sufficient power
      and cooling capacity. Additionally, AI centers generate significant waste
      heat, presenting opportunities to integrate with district heating systems
      and improve overall energy efficiency.
    </p>

    <div class="key-highlight">
      <p>

    <h1 id="conclusion">7. Conclusion and Next Steps</h1>

    <h2 id="strategic-imperative">7.1 Strategic Imperative</h2>

    <p>
      The Nordic AI Initiative is not merely a promising economic prospect—it is
      a <strong>strategic necessity</strong> for preserving European sovereignty
      in a rapidly digitizing world. As artificial intelligence becomes central
      to global competitiveness, national security, and the very fabric of
      democratic governance, Europe faces growing risks from the
      over-concentration of AI capabilities in a few dominant private actors.
      These monopolies not only constrain innovation but challenge the autonomy
      of democratic societies.
    </p>

    <div class="key-highlight">
      <p>
        <strong>The window for action is narrowing.</strong> Early leadership in
        AI infrastructure creates advantages that are hard to overcome later. If
        Europe waits for market forces alone to provide alternatives to private
        monopolies, it will likely find itself outpaced. Deliberate public
        investment is needed to create AI infrastructure that is transparent,
        trusted, and aligned with democratic principles.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2 id="unique-advantages">7.2 Unique Nordic Advantages</h2>

    <p>
      The Nordic region is uniquely positioned to lead this initiative, thanks
      to a rare combination of structural strengths. Globally recognized for
      <strong>ethical governance</strong> and public trust, the region also
      benefits from abundant renewable energy sources—crucial for powering
      sustainable AI operations. Its universities and tech sector provide deep
      technical talent, while sovereign wealth funds and stable public finances
      offer a strong financial foundation.
    </p>

    <p>
      In addition, political stability and mature democratic institutions make
      the Nordics well-suited to steward a long-term, mission-driven AI effort.
      Finally, the region enjoys credibility on the world stage, allowing it to
      champion democratic values in global AI governance.
    </p>

    <h2 id="transformative-potential">7.3 Transformative Potential</h2>
    <p>
      The success of this initiative would ripple far beyond the Nordic region,
      influencing the future of Europe, global democracy, and technological
      progress.
    </p>
    <h3>For Europe</h3>
    <p>
      A thriving Nordic AI effort could prove that democratically governed
      technology can rival or surpass authoritarian and corporate models. It
      would offer EU member states a <strong>trusted alternative</strong> to
      foreign AI systems, while advancing Europe's leadership in AI ethics and
      governance. Beyond trust, this initiative could generate high-value jobs
      and catalyze growth in next-generation technologies.
    </p>
    <h3>For Global Democracy</h3>
    <p>
      The initiative would help reduce global dependence on AI systems developed
      under authoritarian or opaque conditions. It could set new standards for
      accountable AI development and deployment, empower democratic institutions
      with AI-enhanced tools, and act as a global counterweight to
      surveillance-oriented technologies.
    </p>
    <h3>For Technological Progress</h3>
    <p>
      With a focus on openness and safety, the initiative would support
      cutting-edge research in alignment and responsible AI. It could serve as a
      testbed for sustainable AI infrastructure and
      <strong>pioneer democratic models</strong> of technology governance that
      others can emulate.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Leveraging AI Revenues for Social Resilience: A Path Toward Universal
      Basic Income (UBI)
    </h3>
    <p>
      As artificial intelligence transforms the labor market, certain sectors
      and professions will inevitably face disruption and job displacement. The
      Nordic AI Initiative recognizes both the risks and opportunities of this
      transition. To ensure that the benefits of AI-driven productivity gains
      are shared equitably across society, the initiative proposes that a
      portion of future revenues generated by sovereign Nordic AI infrastructure
      be allocated to social innovation—most notably, the gradual introduction
      of a <strong>Universal Basic Income (UBI)</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      This approach would begin with targeted UBI pilot programs in regions or
      sectors most affected by automation, providing a financial safety net for
      workers transitioning to new roles or pursuing retraining. Over time, as
      AI-generated revenues grow, the scope of UBI could be expanded, helping to
      offset income losses, reduce inequality, and support lifelong learning. By
      reinvesting AI profits into social resilience, the Nordics can set a
      global example of how advanced technology can strengthen—rather than
      erode—social solidarity and economic security.
    </p>
    <p>
      This vision aligns with core Nordic values of inclusion and fairness,
      ensuring that technological progress benefits all citizens and that no one
      is left behind in the AI era.
    </p>

    <h2 id="call-to-action">7.4 Call to Action</h2>
    <p>
      To seize this opportunity and mitigate the growing risks, immediate steps
      are required at the national, regional, and EU levels.
    </p>
    <h3>For the Swedish Government</h3>
    <p>
      Sweden should establish a high-level task force, bringing together leaders
      from ministries, academia, and the tech sector. An initial allocation of
      €50 million in the 2025 budget would enable a feasibility study and
      early-stage planning. Engaging regional partners through the Nordic
      Council, and evaluating the potential repurposing of Northvolt assets for
      AI infrastructure, would help accelerate progress.
    </p>
    <h3>For Nordic Partners</h3>
    <p>
      A coordinated Nordic effort is essential. This includes aligning energy
      policies to support cross-border renewable initiatives, harmonizing
      immigration frameworks to facilitate a Nordic AI Visa program, and pooling
      research infrastructure across universities. Presenting a
      <strong>unified Nordic voice</strong> in EU-level AI policy discussions
      will amplify impact.
    </p>
    <h3>For EU Institutions</h3>
    <p>
      European institutions must recognize the Nordic AI Initiative as central
      to digital sovereignty. This includes incorporating it into broader EU
      programs, ensuring regulatory alignment with the AI Act, and co-funding
      through existing investment vehicles. Recognizing AI infrastructure as a
      pillar of European strategic autonomy is not just desirable—it is
      imperative.
    </p>

    <h2 id="historical-parallel">7.5 Historical Parallel and Vision</h2>
    <p>
      This initiative builds on a long tradition of ambitious European
      collaborations—CERN, Airbus, and the European Space Agency among them—that
      successfully combined technological excellence with public purpose. Like
      these, the Nordic AI Initiative could affirm Europe’s ability to
      <strong>lead in critical technologies</strong> without compromising
      democratic values.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nordic leaders now face a pivotal decision: remain dependent on foreign,
      privately controlled AI systems, or invest in sovereign capabilities
      designed to serve democratic interests. This initiative provides a clear
      path toward autonomy, innovation, and leadership in what is arguably the
      defining technology of the century.
    </p>
    <div class="economic-projection">
      <h3>The Vision: AI as Public Infrastructure</h3>
      <p>
        By 2035, the Nordic AI Initiative could form the backbone of European
        digital governance, offering trusted AI services to hundreds of millions
        of citizens. The economic potential is enormous—billions in value
        generation, thousands of jobs—yet the true prize lies in showing the
        world that artificial intelligence can
        <strong>strengthen democracy</strong>, not undermine it.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>
          This is not just an economic opportunity—it is a historic obligation
          to future generations, who deserve AI systems designed to serve, not
          exploit, their societies.
